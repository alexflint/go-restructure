The US economy went through an economic downturn following the financial 
crisis of 2007â€“08, with output as late as 2013 still below potential
according to the Congressional Budget Office.[57] The economy, however,
began to recover in the second half of 2009, and as of November 2015,
unemployment had declined from a high of 10% to 5%; the government's
broader U-6 unemployment rate, which includes the part-time underemployed,
was 9.8% (it had reached 16% in 2009).[13] At 11.3%, the U.S. has one of
the lowest labor union participation rates in the OECD.[58] Households
living on less than $2 per day before government benefits, doubled from
1996 levels to 1.5 million households in 2011, including 2.8 million
children.[59] The gap in income between rich and poor is greater in the
United States than in any other developed country.[60] Total public and
private debt was $50 trillion at the end of the first quarter of 2010,
or 3.5 times GDP.[61] In December 2014, public debt was slightly more
than 100% of GDP.[62] Domestic financial assets totaled $131 trillion
and domestic financial liabilities totaled $106 trillion.[63]
